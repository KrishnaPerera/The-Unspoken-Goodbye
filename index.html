        <div class="story">
            <p>There was a boy who liked a girl, but before he could muster the courage to confess his feelings, she surprised him by asking him first. It felt like something out of a dream-unexpected, yet perfect. For a brief moment, he believed he had found something real, something that could last. But dreams, no matter how beautiful, don’t always endure. A month later, she left with someone from her past who had never considered her before.</p>
            <p>Now, even after time has passed, she lingers in his mind like a shadow he can’t shake. He replays those fleeting months, wondering what changed, what made her walk away so easily. He tells himself to move on, to let go, but deep down, he’s still waiting. It’s not because he’s weak or unable to move forward-it’s because he needs closure. He needs to hear the truth from her, the reason she left, the words she never said.</p>
            <p>Until that day comes, a part of him remains stuck in the past, holding onto the hope that she’ll return-not just to him, but to the moments they once shared. Those memories, though bittersweet, are a reminder of what could have been. He knows he can’t stay trapped in this cycle forever, but for now, he clings to the possibility of answers, of understanding, of a resolution that might finally set him free.</p>
            <p>In the meantime, life goes on, and he tries to piece himself back together. But every now and then, he catches himself wondering if she ever thinks of him, if she ever regrets leaving, or if she’s moved on completely. Until he hears her voice again, until he knows the truth, a part of him will always remain tethered to that brief, beautiful dream that ended too soon <3</p>
